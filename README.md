# Full Stack Project - YC Directory

---

YC Directory is a full-stack SaaS platform where entrepreneurs can pitch their startups and showcase solutions to real-world problems. The platform is built with Next.js on the frontend and uses Sanity as the backend for managing content, while Sentry handles crash reporting, error monitoring, and logging to ensure a seamless experience. Users authenticate through GitHub Login, allowing them to share their ideas, while mentors, editors, and other users can explore and engage with these startups. Future updates will include Google Login for additional authentication options and a voting system to highlight popular ideas. YC Directory promotes collaboration, mentorship, and visibility for innovative projects.
